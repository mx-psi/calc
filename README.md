# Calc

A basic math expressions parser. I tried to do this project when I started learning Haskell without looking at any standard solution or caring too much about efficiency. I have improved some bits so that is easier to understand.

Currently it can parse any expression with basic arithmetic operations (+, -, /, \*) applied to numbers and variables. A variable is any string which is not numeric. Variables starting with `_` are reserved for brackets substitution. It can be easily extended to work with other binary operations.
